# Practice

This is a repo of random tests and things I think I should be learning and always practicing.

## Structure

This project contains numbered directories, each containing a single function.

All the types are provided, but the implementation for each is for you to implement.

Each function has a corresponding `.test.ts` file, which contains unit tests specifying the behavior of each operator.

**Your goal is to get all tests to pass!**

Note that you will need a correct implementation of some previous operators for later tests to pass, so make sure to attempt this in order.

If you get stuck, you can find the solutions in the `__solution__` directory for each exercise. **Try not to look at these!** If you are completely stumped, and you need to just grab the implementation to get going, **don't copy & paste the solution**.

Instead, open it in a separate tab, and type it out yourself. When you only read code, your brain automatically glosses over a lot of the details. When you type the code yourself, you are forced to pay attention to the structure of the code, even if you're just copying it from somewhere else.

**_Have fun!_**

## Setup

1. Clone this repo.
2. `yarn`
3. `yarn test --watch` to run all the tests, and re-run them if you change any files.
4. Open the project in VS Code, and start coding!

## 1. `sum`

As a quick warmup, we'll implement our trusty `sum` function.

It takes two values, adds them together and returns the resulting value.
